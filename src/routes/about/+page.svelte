		<h1>Notice according to the Online Dispute Resolution Regulation:</h1>

		<p>According to applicable law, we are obliged to inform consumers about the existence of the
			European Online Dispute Resolution Platform, which can be used for the resolution of disputes
			without having to involve a court. The establishment of the platform is the responsibility of
			the European Commission. The European Online Dispute Resolution Platform can be found here:
			http://ec.europa.eu/odr. Our email is: infor@tadm-nutrition.de However, we would like to point
			out that we are not willing to participate in the dispute resolution procedure within the
			framework of the European Online Dispute Resolution Platform. Please use our above email to
			contact us.

		<h1>§ 1 Warning Notice about Content</h1>

		<p>The contents of our pages were created with utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the
			accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are
			responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German
			Telemedia Act) and general laws. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider,
			we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to
			investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
			use of information under general law remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this
			respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. If we become
			aware of such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.
		</p>

		<h1>§ 2 External Links</h1>
		<p>This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are
			subject to the liability of the respective operators. The provider has checked the foreign
			content of the external links for any legal violations when they were first linked. No legal
			infringements were apparent at the time. The provider has no influence whatsoever on the
			current and future design and content of the linked pages. The setting of external links does
			not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as his own. A
			constant control of the external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete
			evidence of legal violations. However, such external links will be deleted immediately upon
			knowledge of legal infringements.
		</p>

			written consent of the provider or the respective copyright holder. This applies in particular
			to duplication, editing, translation, storage, processing or reproduction of content in
			databases or other electronic media and systems. Contents and rights of third parties are
			marked as such. The unauthorized duplication or passing on of individual contents or complete
			pages is not permitted and punishable. Only the production of copies and downloads for
			personal, private and not commercial use is allowed. The presentation of this website in
			external frames is only permitted with written permission.

			aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly pointed out at the appropriate place. In
			this case, the special terms of use apply in each individual case.
